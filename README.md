## Why This Project?  
I chose this project to create a helpful tool for sports coaches. Many coaches donâ€™t have digital platforms to manage their team and training efficiently.  

Through this project, I will learn:  
- Building dashboards and forms.  
- Using AI for real-world use cases.  
- Creating interactive planners and visual tools.  
- Managing and analyzing data effectively.
